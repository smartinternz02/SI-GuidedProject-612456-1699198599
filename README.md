-> Project Overview:

The Calorie Burn Prediction System is a web application that provides  accurate estimates of calorie consumption based on the user's physical activity. Users enter data manually, including  personal data such as occupation, duration, age, weight and height. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze these inputs and predict energy consumption.The user interface includes a simple dashboard that displays historical and real-time  calorie consumption data. 
It also includes personalized recommendations to optimize your lifestyle goals. In fact, Burn Prediction System is a great tool for people who want to understand their fitness performance with the simplicity of a web app. 

-> Purpose

The calorie prediction feature is designed to help users understand their calorie intake while working out. This feature calculates calories burned during exercise taking into account individual factors such as gender, age, height, exercise time, heart rate and body temperature. This information not only helps users track their progress, but also allows them to improve their physical performance. 

The main advantages are:
-	Fitness Guidance: By predicting how many calories will be burned during different activities, machine learning models can provide  fitness recommendations. Users can get training plans and exercise suggestions based on their goals, fitness level and needs. 
-	Exercise Optimization: Calorie forecasts can help you optimize your activity by choosing activities that match your desired calorie burn. You can exercise more efficiently and effectively and avoid wasting time on activities that are not aligned with your goals.
